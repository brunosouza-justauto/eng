  - Checks previous sets for the same exercise to find the most recent weight used
  - Automatically applies that weight to the current set
  - Shows a notification to the user: "Using previous weight: X"
  - Marks the set as completed
  - If no previous weight exists, it shows an error asking the user to enter a weight or mark as bodyweight

This feature improves the user experience by reducing repetitive data entry during workouts, making it faster to log sets with the same weight.

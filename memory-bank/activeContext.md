# Active Context: ENG App

## Current Focus

*   **Phase 9: UI Polish & Styling:** Implemented modern UI styling similar to Everfit, with a sidebar navigation, improved dashboard widgets, standardized components, and a light/dark mode toggle feature.

## Recent Changes

*   Completed **Phase 7 & 8 Setup**.
*   Implemented **Phase 9 Layout Basics** (`MainLayout`, `Header`, `Footer`, basic nav).
*   Improved UI with a modern sidebar navigation pattern.
*   Created reusable UI components (`FormInput`, `Button`, `Card`, `Modal`).
*   Added a theme toggle feature to switch between light and dark mode.
*   Implemented theme persistence through Redux and localStorage.
*   Enhanced styling of `LoginPage` with a cleaner, modern design.
*   Improved styling of `DashboardPage` widgets.
*   Added skeleton loading states for improved UX.
*   Implemented better loading/error state indicators.
*   Implemented basic structure and functionality for **Phase 6 Admin CMS** components (`UserManager`, `ProgramBuilder`, `MealPlanner`, `StepGoalSetter`, `CheckInReview`). Pausing further Phase 6 implementation for now.
*   **Fixed Tailwind CSS processing issues** by downgrading from experimental v4.1.4 to stable v3.3.2 and correcting the PostCSS configuration to use the standard `tailwindcss` plugin instead of `@tailwindcss/postcss`.

## Next Steps

1.  ~~Diagnose and fix Tailwind CSS processing issues to ensure styles are properly applied.~~ âœ“ COMPLETED
2.  Further refine dashboard widgets to match new design system.
3.  Implement theming system for consistent colors.
4.  Improve styling of form components in the Onboarding and Check-in pages.
5.  Enhance the Admin CMS interface with the new design system.
6.  Add more detailed loading states and transitions.
7.  Improve responsive design for different screen sizes.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

*   Sidebar navigation pattern with mobile responsiveness.
*   Component-based design system with reusable elements.
*   Light/dark mode implementation using Tailwind's dark mode class approach.
*   Theme preference persistence in Redux with localStorage fallback.
*   Consistent color scheme using Tailwind's indigo as primary color.
*   Clean, modern aesthetic with appropriate white space and card-based layouts.
*   Mobile-first approach enforcement.
*   Dark mode support throughout all components.
*   **Tailwind CSS v3.3.2**: Decided to use the stable version of Tailwind CSS instead of the experimental v4 to ensure compatibility and stability.

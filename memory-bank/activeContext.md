## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Workout Session Enhancement Approach
- Using Web Speech API for voice announcements with user permission system
- Implementing Vibration API for mobile devices with feature detection
- Caching exercise demonstration images to prevent redundant API calls
- Using HeyGainz API to fetch realistic exercise demonstration GIFs
- Providing multi-sensory feedback (visual, audio, tactile) for comprehensive experience
- All feedback systems are opt-in and can be toggled by the user
- Storing user preferences in localStorage for persistence between sessions
- Handling API-provided YouTube links to enable video demonstrations
- Implementing text sanitization to fix encoding issues in external API data

### Multi-Day Meal Planning Approach
- The current system already has day_number field in meals table, supporting multi-day functionality
- Need to decide on UI approach - calendar view vs. tabbed day view vs. scrollable timeline
- Should provide flexibility to create meal templates (e.g., "Training Day", "Rest Day") 
- Consider implementing meal cycles (e.g., 7-day plans that repeat)
- Need to balance simplicity with flexibility for different dietary approaches

### Food Search and Filtering  
- Currently implementing basic category and text search only
- Need more sophisticated filtering by dietary preferences and nutritional content
- Consider indexing strategy for performance with large food database
- Proper unit conversion needs food-specific density information
- Should implement "recently used" or "favorites" functionality

### Nutrition Analytics Requirements
- Need to determine key metrics for nutrition tracking (beyond basic macros)
- Consider how to handle partial adherence and deviations from plan
- Should correlate nutrition adherence with physical progress metrics
- Privacy considerations for sharing nutrition data with coaches
- Performance optimization for handling large datasets of meal records

### Assignment Data Structure
- Using a single `assigned_plans` table for both training programs and nutrition plans
- When assigning either type, we store it in a separate row for the athlete with appropriate fields
- For workout plans, we store `program_template_id` (with `nutrition_plan_id` as NULL)
- For nutrition plans, we store `nutrition_plan_id` (with `program_template_id` as NULL)
- This approach provides flexibility while avoiding complex joins on fetches
- Dashboard queries are now separate for each assignment type for accurate fetching
- We keep only the most recent assignment of each type as the "active" one

### Nutrition Plan Assignments
- Using the same `assigned_plans` table for both training programs and nutrition plans
- Programs use `program_template_id` while nutrition plans use `nutrition_plan_id`
- When assigning a nutrition plan, `program_template_id` is set to `null` and vice versa
- We query with appropriate IS NULL / NOT NULL filters to get the correct type of assignment
- This approach provides flexibility while using existing database schema

- Recipes will be specific to each coach (not shared)
- Food items and recipes will appear in the same search results
- Nutritional values for recipes will be calculated from ingredients
- Meals will remain tied to nutrition plans (not independent)
- We'll implement a comprehensive unit conversion system for food quantities
- Multi-day planning will support different meal plans for training vs. rest days
- When a recipe is added to a meal, it will be broken down into individual items for quantity editing
- Food items are now categorized into standardized groups for better organization and filtering
- Food classifications come from the AFCD dataset and are mapped to standardized food groups

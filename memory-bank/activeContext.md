# Active Context: ENG App

## Current Focus

*   **Phase 9: UI Polish & Styling:** Improving the overall look and feel, starting with foundational elements like layout, navigation, and key pages.

## Recent Changes

*   Completed **Phase 7 & 8 Setup**.
*   Implemented **Phase 9 Layout Basics** (`MainLayout`, `Header`, `Footer`, basic nav).
*   Implemented basic structure and functionality for **Phase 6 Admin CMS** components (`UserManager`, `ProgramBuilder`, `MealPlanner`, `StepGoalSetter`, `CheckInReview`). Pausing further Phase 6 implementation for now.

## Next Steps

1.  Refine `Header` component (consider mobile menu).
2.  Improve styling of `LoginPage`.
3.  Enhance styling of `DashboardPage` widgets.
4.  Improve styling of form components (e.g., `FormInput`, Onboarding, Check-in).
5.  Standardize modal appearance.
6.  Implement better loading/error state indicators.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

*   Overall visual theme (colors, typography - leverage Tailwind defaults or customize?).
*   Component library? (Currently using basic Tailwind, consider Headless UI or similar if needed for complex components like modals/dropdowns).
*   Mobile-first approach reinforcement.

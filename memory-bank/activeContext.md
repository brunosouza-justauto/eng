# Active Context

## Current Focus
We have completed all of the requested improvements to the Program Builder functionality:

### Program Builder Improvements Completed
1. **Layout Adjustment** ✅
   - Changed layout widths: 40% for Exercise Search panel and 60% for Workout Form Fields and Selected Exercises panel
   
2. **Exercise Search Enhancement** ✅
   - Added missing images to exercise cards
   - Restored muscle group search option with a dropdown
   
3. **Exercise Interaction Improvements** ✅
   - Restored drag and drop functionality from Exercise Search panel to Selected Exercises panel
   - Enabled dropping exercises between existing selected exercises
   - Implemented auto-expand of newly added exercises and collapse of existing ones
   
4. **UI Clean-up** ✅
   - Hidden "Week Number" and "Order in Program" fields temporarily
   - Removed the Add Exercise button and modal (using left panel instead)
   - Fixed the checkbox UI by moving it to the left side, away from the delete button
   
5. **Set Types Enhancement** ✅
   - Updated set types to include all from the SETTYPES.md documentation
   - Added informative tooltips explaining each set type

## Recent Changes
- Updated layout of the Program Builder with 40/60 split between exercise search and workout form
- Added muscle group search dropdown for filtering
- Enhanced exercise cards with images
- Moved checkbox to the left side to avoid overlap with the delete button
- Added drag and drop functionality for exercises
- Removed redundant UI elements (Add Exercise button)
- Auto-expand newly added exercises

## Next Steps
- Test the implemented changes
- Address TypeScript linter errors
- Conduct user testing to validate the improvements
- Consider potential refinements to the tooltips and UI

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Set type tooltips use a hover pattern for good user experience
- Exercise cards in the search panel now have a consistent design with images
- Changes were implemented in modular steps to maintain stability
- Some TypeScript type issues need to be addressed in a future update

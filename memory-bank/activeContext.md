# Active Context

## Current Focus
We have made significant improvements to two critical areas of the application:

1. **Exercise Data Fetching Performance** ✅
   - Optimized the exercise data fetching by only retrieving needed exercises instead of the entire database
   - Fixed performance issues when viewing workout details
   - Improved API interaction with HeyGainz service

2. **Dashboard Workout Display** ✅
   - Enhanced the NextWorkoutWidget to show the correct workout based on day of week
   - Added REST DAY display when no workout is assigned for the current day
   - Fixed issue with multiple workouts in a program template
   - Improved the workout information display with day names

## Recent Changes

### Exercise Service Improvements
- Implemented `getExercisesByIds()` function to fetch only specific exercises needed
- Replaced inefficient `getAllExercisesCached()` usage in workout view
- Updated `getExerciseById()` to directly fetch a single exercise from the API
- Added developer documentation for best practices with exercise fetching
- Created a README file for the services directory

### NextWorkoutWidget Improvements
- Removed limit on workouts fetched from program templates
- Added logic to display the workout corresponding to current day of week
- Implemented REST DAY display with program overview
- Removed unused week_number field references
- Added helper functions for day name conversion
- Updated UI to show day names instead of numbers
- Fixed TypeScript type issues for SetType mapping

## Next Steps
- Monitor performance with the optimized exercise fetching
- Consider applying similar optimization to other areas of the application
- Verify REST DAY display logic with extensive testing
- Update database to formally remove the week_number column if no longer needed
- Consider expanding the NextWorkoutWidget to also show upcoming workouts

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Exercise fetching now follows the principle of only loading what's needed
- We're using day of week (1-7 for Monday-Sunday) for workout scheduling
- The REST DAY display provides context by showing all workouts in the program
- Documentation has been added to guide future development
- Performance issues with large datasets should be proactively addressed throughout the application

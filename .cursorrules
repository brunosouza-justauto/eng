# ENG App Project Rules

## Critical Implementation Paths

### Authentication
- Uses Supabase passwordless authentication (magic links)
- Redux store manages auth state (authSlice.ts)
- Protected routes check auth status via selectors

### UI/UX
- Modern sidebar navigation pattern with mobile responsiveness
- Uses Tailwind CSS v3.3.2 (stable version)
- Dark/light mode toggle with persistent preference
- Meal planning components use dark-themed cards with clear content separation
- Nutrition data uses consistent color coding (protein=red, carbs=yellow, fat=blue)
- Homepage uses gradient backgrounds with grid patterns for visual appeal
- Coach profile showcases competition imagery and professional credentials
- Service packages use card-based layout with featured package highlighting

### Navigation
- URL parameters are used to maintain context between related screens
- Query parameters preserve user selections when navigating between components
- Dashboard widgets link to detailed views with preserved context
- Homepage provides clear pathways to login and signup flows

### Meal Planning
- Day types (Rest, Light, Moderate, Heavy, Training) categorize different nutritional needs
- 24-hour time format (00:00-23:59) is used for meal times throughout the application
- Common meal time presets (Breakfast: 08:00, Lunch: 12:30, etc.) aid quick selection
- Meals can be reordered within day types using up/down controls
- Destructive actions (deletion) require confirmation through modal dialogs
- Edit operations reuse creation forms with pre-populated values
- Time picker uses separate hour (00-23) and minute dropdowns with 24-hour display

## Tailwind CSS Configuration

- **Version**: Using stable Tailwind CSS v3.3.2 (NOT v4.x alpha)
- **PostCSS Config**: Uses standard `tailwindcss` plugin in postcss.config.js
- **Custom Components**: Defined in index.css using `@layer components`
- **Dark Mode**: Implemented with Tailwind's class strategy (`darkMode: 'class'`)
- **Theme**: Uses Tailwind's indigo color palette as primary color
- **Common Patterns**: 
  - `pr-4` for table column spacing (not `pr-8` which is too wide)
  - Card headers use `p-4 bg-gray-800` for consistent styling
  - Macro indicators use `text-sm text-gray-400` for secondary information
  - Service package cards use `border-2 border-indigo-500` for featured items
  - Gradient backgrounds use `bg-gradient-to-br from-gray-900 to-indigo-900`
  - Grid patterns use custom CSS with SVG backgrounds
  - Modal dialogs use `fixed inset-0 z-50 overflow-y-auto flex items-center justify-center`
  - Action buttons use contrasting colors to indicate functionality (red for delete, indigo for primary actions)

## Project Structure

- React 18 + Vite
- TypeScript throughout
- Redux + Redux Toolkit for state management
- React Router v7 for routing
- Supabase for backend services

## Common Patterns

- Use React functional components with TypeScript interfaces
- Redux selectors for accessing store state
- Consistent styling with Tailwind CSS classes
- Form handling with React Hook Form
- Data validation with Zod schema
- Nutrition components handle different day types (Rest, Light, Moderate, Heavy)
- Table layouts use consistent spacing with proper column alignment
- URL parameters maintain context across navigation boundaries
- Macronutrient displays follow P/C/F order with consistent color coding
- Social media integration uses standard icon components from react-icons/fi
- Instagram embeds use a custom InstagramEmbed component that dynamically loads Instagram's embed script
- Modal dialogs for complex forms with semi-transparent overlay
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Loading states during async operations
- Error handling with clear user feedback

## Homepage and Marketing Components

- The homepage is the default route for better marketing functionality
- "About Me" section showcases the coach's competition experience and credentials
- Service packages are displayed in card format with clear pricing and features
- Social media links use consistent styling with hover effects
- Instagram embeds provide social proof and showcase the coach's content
- Testimonial section uses card layout with client quotes
- Call-to-action buttons are placed strategically throughout the page
- The hero section includes a prominent tagline and coach image
- Dark themed design with gradient backgrounds creates a premium fitness aesthetic

## Social Media Integration

- Social icons use react-icons/fi package for consistent styling
- Instagram embeds use a dedicated InstagramEmbed component
- Social media embeds are responsive and adapt to different screen sizes
- Links open in new tabs with proper rel attributes for security
- Instagram script is loaded only once using React's useEffect hook
- Component structure preserves performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders

## Known Challenges

- Responsive design needs attention on smallest screen sizes
- Admin CMS data integration is pending
- Some column spacing in tables requires fine-tuning for optimal readability
- Daily nutrition calculations need to account for unlogged days
- Instagram embeds may require periodic updates if Instagram's embedding API changes
- Some TypeScript linter errors in the MealPlannerIntegrated component need attention

## Database Tables

### Nutrition & Meal Logging
- Meal logs are stored in the `meal_logs` table (NOT `logged_meals`)
- Meal logging queries should filter by `user_id`, `log_date`, and `is_extra_meal` flag
- Nutrition plans are stored in `nutrition_plans` table with nested meals and food items
- Meals use `order_in_plan` field for sequencing within day types

### Notification System
- Notifications are stored in the `notifications` table with recipient_id, sender_id, and metadata
- Database triggers automatically generate notifications for key events
- Step goal notifications use `step_entries` and `step_goals` tables to detect achievements
- Notification types are defined in the `NotificationType` TypeScript enum
- Notification handlers map to specific navigation paths based on notification type
- Workout notifications dynamically detect completion based on table structure

## UI/UX Patterns

### Meal Logging Components
- Always provide clear visual feedback for logged meals (checkmark icon)
- Position action buttons at the bottom of meal cards as full-width buttons
- Use explicit text labels with icons for action buttons
- Follow semantic color coding: green for logging actions, red for removal actions
- Display loading spinners during async operations
- Maintain consistent nutritional information display order: P/C/F
- Use ID anchors (e.g., `id="todays-meals"`) for scroll navigation from other components

### Meal Management Components
- Group meals by day type for logical organization
- Display macronutrient breakdowns with consistent color coding
- Use up/down arrows for reordering within day types
- Provide edit and delete controls on each meal card
- Time suggestions use 24-hour format (e.g., "08:00" not "8:00 AM")
- Modal dialogs for edit and create operations
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

### Homepage Components
- Use gradient backgrounds with grid patterns for visual appeal
- Place call-to-action buttons at strategic points throughout the page
- Feature the coach's competition photo prominently to establish credibility
- Use card layouts for service packages with clear pricing and feature lists
- Highlight the featured package with distinct border and styling
- Include social proof through Instagram embeds and testimonials
- Use consistent styling for social media icons with hover effects
- Implement responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes
